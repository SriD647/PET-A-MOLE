# PET-A-MOLE

# **Welcome to PET-A-MOLE!**

## **Game description**
Your lawn has been swarmed by friendly moles and the only way to get them on their way is to show them some LOVE!. The game board is designed to look like a section of your lawn. It has has 9 evenly sized circles in the center, from which the moles will appear and disappear at random in less than a split second. The objective of the game is for the player to click (pet) at least 13 moles with the hand cursor before the 10 second countdown ends. A message will appear at the end of the round to indicate whether the player has won or lost. The game board also consists of a start button (to start a round), a reset button (to reset the game), a score board (to display current score), a timer (to show time remaining in the round), and a human hand cursor.

The game is dervived from the original whack-a-mole, in which the players use a hammer to hit as many moles as possible in a round. However, this game has some controversy around it as the concept technically involves animal abuse. Hence, the game was modified by replacing the idea of hitting the animals to petting them.
